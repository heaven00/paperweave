The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states htsubscript‚Ñéùë°h_{t}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as a function of the previous hidden state ht‚àí1subscript‚Ñéùë°1h_{t-1}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the input for position tùë°titalic_t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\\xa03.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.\\nIn the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,‚Ä¶,xn)subscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõ(x_{1},...,x_{n})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) to a sequence of continuous representations ùê≥=(z1,‚Ä¶,zn)ùê≥subscriptùëß1‚Ä¶subscriptùëßùëõ\\\\mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n})bold_z = ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). Given ùê≥ùê≥\\\\mathbf{z}bold_z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,‚Ä¶,ym)subscriptùë¶1‚Ä¶subscriptùë¶ùëö(y_{1},...,y_{m})( italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure\\xa01, respectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N=6ùëÅ6N=6italic_N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm\\u2062(x+Sublayer\\u2062(x))LayerNormùë•Sublayerùë•\\\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x))roman_LayerNorm ( italic_x + roman_Sublayer ( italic_x ) ), where Sublayer\\u2062(x)Sublayerùë•\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)roman_Sublayer ( italic_x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel=512subscriptùëëmodel512d_{\\\\text{model}}=512italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6ùëÅ6N=6italic_N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position iùëñiitalic_i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than iùëñiitalic_i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure\\xa02). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and values of dimension dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by dksubscriptùëëùëò\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix QùëÑQitalic_Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KùêæKitalic_K and VùëâVitalic_V. We compute the matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention\\u2062(Q,K,V)=softmax\\u2062(Q\\u2062KTdk)\\u2062VAttentionùëÑùêæùëâsoftmaxùëÑsuperscriptùêæùëásubscriptùëëùëòùëâ\\\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\\\mathrm{softmax}(\\\\frac{QK^{T}}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}})Vroman_Attention ( italic_Q , italic_K , italic_V ) = roman_softmax ( divide start_ARG italic_Q italic_K start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG ) italic_V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1dk1subscriptùëëùëò\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [3]. We suspect that for large values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 111To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qùëûqitalic_q and kùëòkitalic_k are independent random variables with mean 00 and variance 1111. Then their dot product, q‚ãÖk=‚àëi=1dkqi\\u2062ki‚ãÖùëûùëòsuperscriptsubscriptùëñ1subscriptùëëùëòsubscriptùëûùëñsubscriptùëòùëñq\\\\cdot k=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{d_{k}}q_{i}k_{i}italic_q ‚ãÖ italic_k = ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, has mean 00 and variance dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1dk1subscriptùëëùëò\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h‚Ñéhitalic_h times with different, learned linear projections to dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT dimensions, respectively.\\nOn each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure\\xa02.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.

This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\\n‚Ä¢\\nThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\\n‚Ä¢\\nSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to ‚àí‚àû-\\\\infty- ‚àû) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure\\xa02.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN\\u2062(x)=max\\u2061(0,x\\u2062W1+b1)\\u2062W2+b2FFNùë•0ùë•subscriptùëä1subscriptùëè1subscriptùëä2subscriptùëè2\\\\mathrm{FFN}(x)=\\\\max(0,xW_{1}+b_{1})W_{2}+b_{2}roman_FFN ( italic_x ) = roman_max ( 0 , italic_x italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_b start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_b start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel=512subscriptùëëmodel512d_{\\\\text{model}}=512italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality df\\u2062f=2048subscriptùëëùëìùëì2048d_{ff}=2048italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by dmodelsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\sqrt{d_{\\\\text{model}}}square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP\\u2062E(p\\u2062o\\u2062s,2\\u2062i)=s\\u2062i\\u2062n\\u2062(p\\u2062o\\u2062s/100002\\u2062i/dmodel)ùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†2ùëñùë†ùëñùëõùëùùëúùë†superscript100002ùëñsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\displaystyle PE_{(pos,2i)}=sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_p italic_o italic_s , 2 italic_i ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_s italic_i italic_n ( italic_p italic_o italic_s / 10000 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 italic_i / italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nP\\u2062E(p\\u2062o\\u2062s,2\\u2062i+1)=c\\u2062o\\u2062s\\u2062(p\\u2062o\\u2062s/100002\\u2062i/dmodel)ùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†2ùëñ1ùëêùëúùë†ùëùùëúùë†superscript100002ùëñsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\displaystyle PE_{(pos,2i+1)}=cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_p italic_o italic_s , 2 italic_i + 1 ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_c italic_o italic_s ( italic_p italic_o italic_s / 10000 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 italic_i / italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nwhere p\\u2062o\\u2062sùëùùëúùë†positalic_p italic_o italic_s is the position and iùëñiitalic_i is the dimension.

We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1,‚Ä¶,xn)subscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõ(x_{1},...,x_{n})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) to another sequence of equal length (z1,‚Ä¶,zn)subscriptùëß1‚Ä¶subscriptùëßùëõ(z_{1},...,z_{n})( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), with xi,zi‚àà‚Ñùdsubscriptùë•ùëñsubscriptùëßùëñsuperscript‚Ñùùëëx_{i},z_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer.\\nAnother is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\\nTable 1:\\nMaximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. nùëõnitalic_n is the sequence length, dùëëditalic_d is the representation dimension, kùëòkitalic_k is the kernel size of convolutions and rùëüritalic_r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO\\u2062(n2‚ãÖd)ùëÇ‚ãÖsuperscriptùëõ2ùëëO(n^{2}\\\\cdot d)italic_O ( italic_n start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚ãÖ italic_d )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nRecurrent\\nO\\u2062(n‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nO\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n )\\nO\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n )\\nConvolutional\\nO\\u2062(k‚ãÖn‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëòùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_k ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(l\\u2062o\\u2062gk\\u2062(n))ùëÇùëôùëúsubscriptùëîùëòùëõO(log_{k}(n))italic_O ( italic_l italic_o italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n ) )\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO\\u2062(r‚ãÖn‚ãÖd)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëüùëõùëëO(r\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d)italic_O ( italic_r ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(n/r)ùëÇùëõùëüO(n/r)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_r )\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n ) sequential operations.\\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length nùëõnitalic_n is smaller than the representation dimensionality dùëëditalic_d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations.\\nTo improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rùëüritalic_r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O\\u2062(n/r)ùëÇùëõùëüO(n/r)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_r ). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<nùëòùëõk<nitalic_k < italic_n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O\\u2062(n/k)ùëÇùëõùëòO(n/k)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O\\u2062(l\\u2062o\\u2062gk\\u2062(n))ùëÇùëôùëúsubscriptùëîùëòùëõO(log_{k}(n))italic_O ( italic_l italic_o italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n ) ) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.\\nConvolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of kùëòkitalic_k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O\\u2062(k‚ãÖn‚ãÖd+n‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëòùëõùëë‚ãÖùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d+n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_k ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d + italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Even with k=nùëòùëõk=nitalic_k = italic_n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer\\xa0[20] with Œ≤1=0.9subscriptùõΩ10.9\\\\beta_{1}=0.9italic_Œ≤ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.9, Œ≤2=0.98subscriptùõΩ20.98\\\\beta_{2}=0.98italic_Œ≤ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.98 and œµ=10‚àí9italic-œµsuperscript109\\\\epsilon=10^{-9}italic_œµ = 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.

In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of Pd\\u2062r\\u2062o\\u2062p=0.1subscriptùëÉùëëùëüùëúùëù0.1P_{drop}=0.1italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d italic_r italic_o italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value œµl\\u2062s=0.1subscriptitalic-œµùëôùë†0.1\\\\epsilon_{ls}=0.1italic_œµ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.1 [36].

We present these results in Table\\xa03.\\nIn Table\\xa03 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table\\xa03 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input.\\nFurthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dm\\u2062o\\u2062d\\u2062e\\u2062l=1024subscriptùëëùëöùëúùëëùëíùëô1024d_{model}=1024italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_o italic_d italic_e italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section\\xa05.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we increased the maximum output length to input length + 300300300300. We used a beam size of 21212121 and Œ±=0.3ùõº0.3\\\\alpha=0.3italic_Œ± = 0.3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\\nOur results in Table\\xa04 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.\\nMaking generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for\\ntheir fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]\\nJimmy\\xa0Lei Ba, Jamie\\xa0Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey\\xa0E Hinton.\\nLayer normalization.\\narXiv preprint arXiv:1607.06450, 2016.\\n[2]\\nDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio.\\nNeural machine translation by jointly learning to align and\\ntranslate.\\nCoRR, abs/1409.0473, 2014.\\n[3]\\nDenny Britz, Anna Goldie, Minh-Thang Luong, and Quoc\\xa0V.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states htsubscript‚Ñéùë°h_{t}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as a function of the previous hidden state ht‚àí1subscript‚Ñéùë°1h_{t-1}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the input for position tùë°titalic_t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\\xa03.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.\\nIn the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,‚Ä¶,xn)subscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõ(x_{1},...,x_{n})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) to a sequence of continuous representations ùê≥=(z1,‚Ä¶,zn)ùê≥subscriptùëß1‚Ä¶subscriptùëßùëõ\\\\mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n})bold_z = ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). Given ùê≥ùê≥\\\\mathbf{z}bold_z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,‚Ä¶,ym)subscriptùë¶1‚Ä¶subscriptùë¶ùëö(y_{1},...,y_{m})( italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure\\xa01, respectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N=6ùëÅ6N=6italic_N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm\\u2062(x+Sublayer\\u2062(x))LayerNormùë•Sublayerùë•\\\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x))roman_LayerNorm ( italic_x + roman_Sublayer ( italic_x ) ), where Sublayer\\u2062(x)Sublayerùë•\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)roman_Sublayer ( italic_x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel=512subscriptùëëmodel512d_{\\\\text{model}}=512italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6ùëÅ6N=6italic_N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position iùëñiitalic_i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than iùëñiitalic_i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure\\xa02). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and values of dimension dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by dksubscriptùëëùëò\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix QùëÑQitalic_Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KùêæKitalic_K and VùëâVitalic_V. We compute the matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention\\u2062(Q,K,V)=softmax\\u2062(Q\\u2062KTdk)\\u2062VAttentionùëÑùêæùëâsoftmaxùëÑsuperscriptùêæùëásubscriptùëëùëòùëâ\\\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\\\mathrm{softmax}(\\\\frac{QK^{T}}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}})Vroman_Attention ( italic_Q , italic_K , italic_V ) = roman_softmax ( divide start_ARG italic_Q italic_K start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG ) italic_V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1dk1subscriptùëëùëò\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [3]. We suspect that for large values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 111To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qùëûqitalic_q and kùëòkitalic_k are independent random variables with mean 00 and variance 1111. Then their dot product, q‚ãÖk=‚àëi=1dkqi\\u2062ki‚ãÖùëûùëòsuperscriptsubscriptùëñ1subscriptùëëùëòsubscriptùëûùëñsubscriptùëòùëñq\\\\cdot k=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{d_{k}}q_{i}k_{i}italic_q ‚ãÖ italic_k = ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, has mean 00 and variance dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1dk1subscriptùëëùëò\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h‚Ñéhitalic_h times with different, learned linear projections to dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT dimensions, respectively.\\nOn each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure\\xa02.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead\\u2062(Q,K,V)MultiHeadùëÑùêæùëâ\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathrm{MultiHead}(Q,K,V)roman_MultiHead ( italic_Q , italic_K , italic_V )\\n=Concat\\u2062(head1,‚Ä¶,headh)\\u2062WOabsentConcatsubscripthead1‚Ä¶subscriptheadhsuperscriptùëäùëÇ\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathrm{Concat}(\\\\mathrm{head_{1}},...,\\\\mathrm{head_{h}})W^{O}= roman_Concat ( roman_head start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , roman_head start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_O end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\\nwhere\\u2062headiwheresubscriptheadi\\\\displaystyle\\\\text{where}~{}\\\\mathrm{head_{i}}where roman_head start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n=Attention\\u2062(Q\\u2062WiQ,K\\u2062WiK,V\\u2062WiV)absentAttentionùëÑsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëÑùëñùêæsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùêæùëñùëâsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëâùëñ\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathrm{Attention}(QW^{Q}_{i},KW^{K}_{i},VW^{V}_{i})= roman_Attention ( italic_Q italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Q end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_K italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_V italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WiQ‚àà‚Ñùdmodel√ódksubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëÑùëñsuperscript‚ÑùsubscriptùëëmodelsubscriptùëëùëòW^{Q}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{k}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Q end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, WiK‚àà‚Ñùdmodel√ódksubscriptsuperscriptùëäùêæùëñsuperscript‚ÑùsubscriptùëëmodelsubscriptùëëùëòW^{K}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{k}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, WiV‚àà‚Ñùdmodel√ódvsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëâùëñsuperscript‚Ñùsubscriptùëëmodelsubscriptùëëùë£W^{V}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{v}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and WO‚àà‚Ñùh\\u2062dv√ódmodelsuperscriptùëäùëÇsuperscript‚Ñù‚Ñésubscriptùëëùë£subscriptùëëmodelW^{O}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{hd_{v}\\\\times d_{\\\\text{model}}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_O end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.\\nIn this work we employ h=8‚Ñé8h=8italic_h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads.

This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\\n‚Ä¢\\nThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\\n‚Ä¢\\nSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to ‚àí‚àû-\\\\infty- ‚àû) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure\\xa02.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN\\u2062(x)=max\\u2061(0,x\\u2062W1+b1)\\u2062W2+b2FFNùë•0ùë•subscriptùëä1subscriptùëè1subscriptùëä2subscriptùëè2\\\\mathrm{FFN}(x)=\\\\max(0,xW_{1}+b_{1})W_{2}+b_{2}roman_FFN ( italic_x ) = roman_max ( 0 , italic_x italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_b start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_b start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel=512subscriptùëëmodel512d_{\\\\text{model}}=512italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality df\\u2062f=2048subscriptùëëùëìùëì2048d_{ff}=2048italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by dmodelsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\sqrt{d_{\\\\text{model}}}square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP\\u2062E(p\\u2062o\\u2062s,2\\u2062i)=s\\u2062i\\u2062n\\u2062(p\\u2062o\\u2062s/100002\\u2062i/dmodel)ùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†2ùëñùë†ùëñùëõùëùùëúùë†superscript100002ùëñsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\displaystyle PE_{(pos,2i)}=sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_p italic_o italic_s , 2 italic_i ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_s italic_i italic_n ( italic_p italic_o italic_s / 10000 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 italic_i / italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nP\\u2062E(p\\u2062o\\u2062s,2\\u2062i+1)=c\\u2062o\\u2062s\\u2062(p\\u2062o\\u2062s/100002\\u2062i/dmodel)ùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†2ùëñ1ùëêùëúùë†ùëùùëúùë†superscript100002ùëñsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\displaystyle PE_{(pos,2i+1)}=cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_p italic_o italic_s , 2 italic_i + 1 ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_c italic_o italic_s ( italic_p italic_o italic_s / 10000 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 italic_i / italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nwhere p\\u2062o\\u2062sùëùùëúùë†positalic_p italic_o italic_s is the position and iùëñiitalic_i is the dimension.

We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset kùëòkitalic_k, P\\u2062Ep\\u2062o\\u2062s+kùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†ùëòPE_{pos+k}italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p italic_o italic_s + italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can be represented as a linear function of P\\u2062Ep\\u2062o\\u2062sùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†PE_{pos}italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p italic_o italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table\\xa03 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1,‚Ä¶,xn)subscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõ(x_{1},...,x_{n})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) to another sequence of equal length (z1,‚Ä¶,zn)subscriptùëß1‚Ä¶subscriptùëßùëõ(z_{1},...,z_{n})( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), with xi,zi‚àà‚Ñùdsubscriptùë•ùëñsubscriptùëßùëñsuperscript‚Ñùùëëx_{i},z_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer.\\nAnother is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\\nTable 1:\\nMaximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. nùëõnitalic_n is the sequence length, dùëëditalic_d is the representation dimension, kùëòkitalic_k is the kernel size of convolutions and rùëüritalic_r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO\\u2062(n2‚ãÖd)ùëÇ‚ãÖsuperscriptùëõ2ùëëO(n^{2}\\\\cdot d)italic_O ( italic_n start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚ãÖ italic_d )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nRecurrent\\nO\\u2062(n‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nO\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n )\\nO\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n )\\nConvolutional\\nO\\u2062(k‚ãÖn‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëòùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_k ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(l\\u2062o\\u2062gk\\u2062(n))ùëÇùëôùëúsubscriptùëîùëòùëõO(log_{k}(n))italic_O ( italic_l italic_o italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n ) )\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO\\u2062(r‚ãÖn‚ãÖd)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëüùëõùëëO(r\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d)italic_O ( italic_r ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(n/r)ùëÇùëõùëüO(n/r)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_r )\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n ) sequential operations.\\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length nùëõnitalic_n is smaller than the representation dimensionality dùëëditalic_d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations.\\nTo improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rùëüritalic_r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O\\u2062(n/r)ùëÇùëõùëüO(n/r)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_r ). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<nùëòùëõk<nitalic_k < italic_n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O\\u2062(n/k)ùëÇùëõùëòO(n/k)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O\\u2062(l\\u2062o\\u2062gk\\u2062(n))ùëÇùëôùëúsubscriptùëîùëòùëõO(log_{k}(n))italic_O ( italic_l italic_o italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n ) ) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.\\nConvolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of kùëòkitalic_k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O\\u2062(k‚ãÖn‚ãÖd+n‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëòùëõùëë‚ãÖùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d+n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_k ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d + italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Even with k=nùëòùëõk=nitalic_k = italic_n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer\\xa0[20] with Œ≤1=0.9subscriptùõΩ10.9\\\\beta_{1}=0.9italic_Œ≤ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.9, Œ≤2=0.98subscriptùõΩ20.98\\\\beta_{2}=0.98italic_Œ≤ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.98 and œµ=10‚àí9italic-œµsuperscript109\\\\epsilon=10^{-9}italic_œµ = 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table\\xa03.\\nIn Table\\xa03 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table\\xa03 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input.\\nFurthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dm\\u2062o\\u2062d\\u2062e\\u2062l=1024subscriptùëëùëöùëúùëëùëíùëô1024d_{model}=1024italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_o italic_d italic_e italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section\\xa05.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we increased the maximum output length to input length + 300300300300. We used a beam size of 21212121 and Œ±=0.3ùõº0.3\\\\alpha=0.3italic_Œ± = 0.3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\\nOur results in Table\\xa04 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.\\nMaking generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for\\ntheir fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]\\nJimmy\\xa0Lei Ba, Jamie\\xa0Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey\\xa0E Hinton.\\nLayer normalization.\\narXiv preprint arXiv:1607.06450, 2016.\\n[2]\\nDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio.\\nNeural machine translation by jointly learning to align and\\ntranslate.\\nCoRR, abs/1409.0473, 2014.\\n[3]\\nDenny Britz, Anna Goldie, Minh-Thang Luong, and Quoc\\xa0V.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states htsubscript‚Ñéùë°h_{t}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as a function of the previous hidden state ht‚àí1subscript‚Ñéùë°1h_{t-1}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the input for position tùë°titalic_t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\\xa03.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.\\nIn the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,‚Ä¶,xn)subscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõ(x_{1},...,x_{n})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) to a sequence of continuous representations ùê≥=(z1,‚Ä¶,zn)ùê≥subscriptùëß1‚Ä¶subscriptùëßùëõ\\\\mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n})bold_z = ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). Given ùê≥ùê≥\\\\mathbf{z}bold_z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,‚Ä¶,ym)subscriptùë¶1‚Ä¶subscriptùë¶ùëö(y_{1},...,y_{m})( italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure\\xa01, respectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N=6ùëÅ6N=6italic_N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm\\u2062(x+Sublayer\\u2062(x))LayerNormùë•Sublayerùë•\\\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x))roman_LayerNorm ( italic_x + roman_Sublayer ( italic_x ) ), where Sublayer\\u2062(x)Sublayerùë•\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)roman_Sublayer ( italic_x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel=512subscriptùëëmodel512d_{\\\\text{model}}=512italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6ùëÅ6N=6italic_N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position iùëñiitalic_i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than iùëñiitalic_i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure\\xa02). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and values of dimension dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by dksubscriptùëëùëò\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix QùëÑQitalic_Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KùêæKitalic_K and VùëâVitalic_V. We compute the matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention\\u2062(Q,K,V)=softmax\\u2062(Q\\u2062KTdk)\\u2062VAttentionùëÑùêæùëâsoftmaxùëÑsuperscriptùêæùëásubscriptùëëùëòùëâ\\\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\\\mathrm{softmax}(\\\\frac{QK^{T}}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}})Vroman_Attention ( italic_Q , italic_K , italic_V ) = roman_softmax ( divide start_ARG italic_Q italic_K start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG ) italic_V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1dk1subscriptùëëùëò\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [3]. We suspect that for large values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 111To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qùëûqitalic_q and kùëòkitalic_k are independent random variables with mean 00 and variance 1111. Then their dot product, q‚ãÖk=‚àëi=1dkqi\\u2062ki‚ãÖùëûùëòsuperscriptsubscriptùëñ1subscriptùëëùëòsubscriptùëûùëñsubscriptùëòùëñq\\\\cdot k=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{d_{k}}q_{i}k_{i}italic_q ‚ãÖ italic_k = ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, has mean 00 and variance dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1dk1subscriptùëëùëò\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h‚Ñéhitalic_h times with different, learned linear projections to dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT dimensions, respectively.\\nOn each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure\\xa02.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead\\u2062(Q,K,V)MultiHeadùëÑùêæùëâ\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathrm{MultiHead}(Q,K,V)roman_MultiHead ( italic_Q , italic_K , italic_V )\\n=Concat\\u2062(head1,‚Ä¶,headh)\\u2062WOabsentConcatsubscripthead1‚Ä¶subscriptheadhsuperscriptùëäùëÇ\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathrm{Concat}(\\\\mathrm{head_{1}},...,\\\\mathrm{head_{h}})W^{O}= roman_Concat ( roman_head start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , roman_head start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_O end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\\nwhere\\u2062headiwheresubscriptheadi\\\\displaystyle\\\\text{where}~{}\\\\mathrm{head_{i}}where roman_head start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n=Attention\\u2062(Q\\u2062WiQ,K\\u2062WiK,V\\u2062WiV)absentAttentionùëÑsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëÑùëñùêæsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùêæùëñùëâsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëâùëñ\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathrm{Attention}(QW^{Q}_{i},KW^{K}_{i},VW^{V}_{i})= roman_Attention ( italic_Q italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Q end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_K italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_V italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WiQ‚àà‚Ñùdmodel√ódksubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëÑùëñsuperscript‚ÑùsubscriptùëëmodelsubscriptùëëùëòW^{Q}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{k}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Q end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, WiK‚àà‚Ñùdmodel√ódksubscriptsuperscriptùëäùêæùëñsuperscript‚ÑùsubscriptùëëmodelsubscriptùëëùëòW^{K}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{k}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, WiV‚àà‚Ñùdmodel√ódvsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëâùëñsuperscript‚Ñùsubscriptùëëmodelsubscriptùëëùë£W^{V}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{v}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and WO‚àà‚Ñùh\\u2062dv√ódmodelsuperscriptùëäùëÇsuperscript‚Ñù‚Ñésubscriptùëëùë£subscriptùëëmodelW^{O}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{hd_{v}\\\\times d_{\\\\text{model}}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_O end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.\\nIn this work we employ h=8‚Ñé8h=8italic_h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads.

This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\\n‚Ä¢\\nThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\\n‚Ä¢\\nSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to ‚àí‚àû-\\\\infty- ‚àû) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure\\xa02.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN\\u2062(x)=max\\u2061(0,x\\u2062W1+b1)\\u2062W2+b2FFNùë•0ùë•subscriptùëä1subscriptùëè1subscriptùëä2subscriptùëè2\\\\mathrm{FFN}(x)=\\\\max(0,xW_{1}+b_{1})W_{2}+b_{2}roman_FFN ( italic_x ) = roman_max ( 0 , italic_x italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_b start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_b start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel=512subscriptùëëmodel512d_{\\\\text{model}}=512italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality df\\u2062f=2048subscriptùëëùëìùëì2048d_{ff}=2048italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by dmodelsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\sqrt{d_{\\\\text{model}}}square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP\\u2062E(p\\u2062o\\u2062s,2\\u2062i)=s\\u2062i\\u2062n\\u2062(p\\u2062o\\u2062s/100002\\u2062i/dmodel)ùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†2ùëñùë†ùëñùëõùëùùëúùë†superscript100002ùëñsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\displaystyle PE_{(pos,2i)}=sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_p italic_o italic_s , 2 italic_i ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_s italic_i italic_n ( italic_p italic_o italic_s / 10000 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 italic_i / italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nP\\u2062E(p\\u2062o\\u2062s,2\\u2062i+1)=c\\u2062o\\u2062s\\u2062(p\\u2062o\\u2062s/100002\\u2062i/dmodel)ùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†2ùëñ1ùëêùëúùë†ùëùùëúùë†superscript100002ùëñsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\displaystyle PE_{(pos,2i+1)}=cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_p italic_o italic_s , 2 italic_i + 1 ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_c italic_o italic_s ( italic_p italic_o italic_s / 10000 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 italic_i / italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nwhere p\\u2062o\\u2062sùëùùëúùë†positalic_p italic_o italic_s is the position and iùëñiitalic_i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid.

We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1,‚Ä¶,xn)subscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõ(x_{1},...,x_{n})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) to another sequence of equal length (z1,‚Ä¶,zn)subscriptùëß1‚Ä¶subscriptùëßùëõ(z_{1},...,z_{n})( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), with xi,zi‚àà‚Ñùdsubscriptùë•ùëñsubscriptùëßùëñsuperscript‚Ñùùëëx_{i},z_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer.\\nAnother is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\\nTable 1:\\nMaximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. nùëõnitalic_n is the sequence length, dùëëditalic_d is the representation dimension, kùëòkitalic_k is the kernel size of convolutions and rùëüritalic_r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO\\u2062(n2‚ãÖd)ùëÇ‚ãÖsuperscriptùëõ2ùëëO(n^{2}\\\\cdot d)italic_O ( italic_n start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚ãÖ italic_d )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nRecurrent\\nO\\u2062(n‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nO\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n )\\nO\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n )\\nConvolutional\\nO\\u2062(k‚ãÖn‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëòùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_k ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(l\\u2062o\\u2062gk\\u2062(n))ùëÇùëôùëúsubscriptùëîùëòùëõO(log_{k}(n))italic_O ( italic_l italic_o italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n ) )\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO\\u2062(r‚ãÖn‚ãÖd)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëüùëõùëëO(r\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d)italic_O ( italic_r ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(n/r)ùëÇùëõùëüO(n/r)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_r )\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n ) sequential operations.\\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length nùëõnitalic_n is smaller than the representation dimensionality dùëëditalic_d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations.\\nTo improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rùëüritalic_r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O\\u2062(n/r)ùëÇùëõùëüO(n/r)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_r ). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<nùëòùëõk<nitalic_k < italic_n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O\\u2062(n/k)ùëÇùëõùëòO(n/k)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O\\u2062(l\\u2062o\\u2062gk\\u2062(n))ùëÇùëôùëúsubscriptùëîùëòùëõO(log_{k}(n))italic_O ( italic_l italic_o italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n ) ) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.\\nConvolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of kùëòkitalic_k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O\\u2062(k‚ãÖn‚ãÖd+n‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëòùëõùëë‚ãÖùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d+n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_k ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d + italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Even with k=nùëòùëõk=nitalic_k = italic_n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer\\xa0[20] with Œ≤1=0.9subscriptùõΩ10.9\\\\beta_{1}=0.9italic_Œ≤ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.9, Œ≤2=0.98subscriptùõΩ20.98\\\\beta_{2}=0.98italic_Œ≤ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.98 and œµ=10‚àí9italic-œµsuperscript109\\\\epsilon=10^{-9}italic_œµ = 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.

In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of Pd\\u2062r\\u2062o\\u2062p=0.1subscriptùëÉùëëùëüùëúùëù0.1P_{drop}=0.1italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d italic_r italic_o italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value œµl\\u2062s=0.1subscriptitalic-œµùëôùë†0.1\\\\epsilon_{ls}=0.1italic_œµ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.1 [36].

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table\\xa03.\\nIn Table\\xa03 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table\\xa03 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input.\\nFurthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dm\\u2062o\\u2062d\\u2062e\\u2062l=1024subscriptùëëùëöùëúùëëùëíùëô1024d_{model}=1024italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_o italic_d italic_e italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section\\xa05.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we increased the maximum output length to input length + 300300300300. We used a beam size of 21212121 and Œ±=0.3ùõº0.3\\\\alpha=0.3italic_Œ± = 0.3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\\nOur results in Table\\xa04 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.\\nMaking generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for\\ntheir fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]\\nJimmy\\xa0Lei Ba, Jamie\\xa0Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey\\xa0E Hinton.\\nLayer normalization.\\narXiv preprint arXiv:1607.06450, 2016.\\n[2]\\nDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio.\\nNeural machine translation by jointly learning to align and\\ntranslate.\\nCoRR, abs/1409.0473, 2014.\\n[3]\\nDenny Britz, Anna Goldie, Minh-Thang Luong, and Quoc\\xa0V.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states htsubscript‚Ñéùë°h_{t}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as a function of the previous hidden state ht‚àí1subscript‚Ñéùë°1h_{t-1}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the input for position tùë°titalic_t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\\xa03.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.\\nIn the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,‚Ä¶,xn)subscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõ(x_{1},...,x_{n})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) to a sequence of continuous representations ùê≥=(z1,‚Ä¶,zn)ùê≥subscriptùëß1‚Ä¶subscriptùëßùëõ\\\\mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n})bold_z = ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). Given ùê≥ùê≥\\\\mathbf{z}bold_z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,‚Ä¶,ym)subscriptùë¶1‚Ä¶subscriptùë¶ùëö(y_{1},...,y_{m})( italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure\\xa01, respectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N=6ùëÅ6N=6italic_N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm\\u2062(x+Sublayer\\u2062(x))LayerNormùë•Sublayerùë•\\\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x))roman_LayerNorm ( italic_x + roman_Sublayer ( italic_x ) ), where Sublayer\\u2062(x)Sublayerùë•\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)roman_Sublayer ( italic_x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel=512subscriptùëëmodel512d_{\\\\text{model}}=512italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6ùëÅ6N=6italic_N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position iùëñiitalic_i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than iùëñiitalic_i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure\\xa02). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and values of dimension dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by dksubscriptùëëùëò\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix QùëÑQitalic_Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KùêæKitalic_K and VùëâVitalic_V. We compute the matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention\\u2062(Q,K,V)=softmax\\u2062(Q\\u2062KTdk)\\u2062VAttentionùëÑùêæùëâsoftmaxùëÑsuperscriptùêæùëásubscriptùëëùëòùëâ\\\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\\\mathrm{softmax}(\\\\frac{QK^{T}}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}})Vroman_Attention ( italic_Q , italic_K , italic_V ) = roman_softmax ( divide start_ARG italic_Q italic_K start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG ) italic_V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1dk1subscriptùëëùëò\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [3]. We suspect that for large values of dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 111To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qùëûqitalic_q and kùëòkitalic_k are independent random variables with mean 00 and variance 1111. Then their dot product, q‚ãÖk=‚àëi=1dkqi\\u2062ki‚ãÖùëûùëòsuperscriptsubscriptùëñ1subscriptùëëùëòsubscriptùëûùëñsubscriptùëòùëñq\\\\cdot k=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{d_{k}}q_{i}k_{i}italic_q ‚ãÖ italic_k = ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, has mean 00 and variance dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1dk1subscriptùëëùëò\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h‚Ñéhitalic_h times with different, learned linear projections to dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT dimensions, respectively.\\nOn each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dvsubscriptùëëùë£d_{v}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure\\xa02.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead\\u2062(Q,K,V)MultiHeadùëÑùêæùëâ\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathrm{MultiHead}(Q,K,V)roman_MultiHead ( italic_Q , italic_K , italic_V )\\n=Concat\\u2062(head1,‚Ä¶,headh)\\u2062WOabsentConcatsubscripthead1‚Ä¶subscriptheadhsuperscriptùëäùëÇ\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathrm{Concat}(\\\\mathrm{head_{1}},...,\\\\mathrm{head_{h}})W^{O}= roman_Concat ( roman_head start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , roman_head start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_O end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\\nwhere\\u2062headiwheresubscriptheadi\\\\displaystyle\\\\text{where}~{}\\\\mathrm{head_{i}}where roman_head start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n=Attention\\u2062(Q\\u2062WiQ,K\\u2062WiK,V\\u2062WiV)absentAttentionùëÑsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëÑùëñùêæsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùêæùëñùëâsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëâùëñ\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathrm{Attention}(QW^{Q}_{i},KW^{K}_{i},VW^{V}_{i})= roman_Attention ( italic_Q italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Q end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_K italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_V italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WiQ‚àà‚Ñùdmodel√ódksubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëÑùëñsuperscript‚ÑùsubscriptùëëmodelsubscriptùëëùëòW^{Q}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{k}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Q end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, WiK‚àà‚Ñùdmodel√ódksubscriptsuperscriptùëäùêæùëñsuperscript‚ÑùsubscriptùëëmodelsubscriptùëëùëòW^{K}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{k}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, WiV‚àà‚Ñùdmodel√ódvsubscriptsuperscriptùëäùëâùëñsuperscript‚Ñùsubscriptùëëmodelsubscriptùëëùë£W^{V}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{v}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and WO‚àà‚Ñùh\\u2062dv√ódmodelsuperscriptùëäùëÇsuperscript‚Ñù‚Ñésubscriptùëëùë£subscriptùëëmodelW^{O}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{hd_{v}\\\\times d_{\\\\text{model}}}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_O end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.\\nIn this work we employ h=8‚Ñé8h=8italic_h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads.

This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\\n‚Ä¢\\nThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\\n‚Ä¢\\nSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to ‚àí‚àû-\\\\infty- ‚àû) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure\\xa02.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN\\u2062(x)=max\\u2061(0,x\\u2062W1+b1)\\u2062W2+b2FFNùë•0ùë•subscriptùëä1subscriptùëè1subscriptùëä2subscriptùëè2\\\\mathrm{FFN}(x)=\\\\max(0,xW_{1}+b_{1})W_{2}+b_{2}roman_FFN ( italic_x ) = roman_max ( 0 , italic_x italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_b start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_b start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel=512subscriptùëëmodel512d_{\\\\text{model}}=512italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality df\\u2062f=2048subscriptùëëùëìùëì2048d_{ff}=2048italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by dmodelsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\sqrt{d_{\\\\text{model}}}square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodelsubscriptùëëmodeld_{\\\\text{model}}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP\\u2062E(p\\u2062o\\u2062s,2\\u2062i)=s\\u2062i\\u2062n\\u2062(p\\u2062o\\u2062s/100002\\u2062i/dmodel)ùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†2ùëñùë†ùëñùëõùëùùëúùë†superscript100002ùëñsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\displaystyle PE_{(pos,2i)}=sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_p italic_o italic_s , 2 italic_i ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_s italic_i italic_n ( italic_p italic_o italic_s / 10000 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 italic_i / italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nP\\u2062E(p\\u2062o\\u2062s,2\\u2062i+1)=c\\u2062o\\u2062s\\u2062(p\\u2062o\\u2062s/100002\\u2062i/dmodel)ùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†2ùëñ1ùëêùëúùë†ùëùùëúùë†superscript100002ùëñsubscriptùëëmodel\\\\displaystyle PE_{(pos,2i+1)}=cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_p italic_o italic_s , 2 italic_i + 1 ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_c italic_o italic_s ( italic_p italic_o italic_s / 10000 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 italic_i / italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nwhere p\\u2062o\\u2062sùëùùëúùë†positalic_p italic_o italic_s is the position and iùëñiitalic_i is the dimension.

We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset kùëòkitalic_k, P\\u2062Ep\\u2062o\\u2062s+kùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†ùëòPE_{pos+k}italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p italic_o italic_s + italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can be represented as a linear function of P\\u2062Ep\\u2062o\\u2062sùëÉsubscriptùê∏ùëùùëúùë†PE_{pos}italic_P italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p italic_o italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table\\xa03 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1,‚Ä¶,xn)subscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõ(x_{1},...,x_{n})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) to another sequence of equal length (z1,‚Ä¶,zn)subscriptùëß1‚Ä¶subscriptùëßùëõ(z_{1},...,z_{n})( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), with xi,zi‚àà‚Ñùdsubscriptùë•ùëñsubscriptùëßùëñsuperscript‚Ñùùëëx_{i},z_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer.\\nAnother is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\\nTable 1:\\nMaximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. nùëõnitalic_n is the sequence length, dùëëditalic_d is the representation dimension, kùëòkitalic_k is the kernel size of convolutions and rùëüritalic_r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO\\u2062(n2‚ãÖd)ùëÇ‚ãÖsuperscriptùëõ2ùëëO(n^{2}\\\\cdot d)italic_O ( italic_n start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚ãÖ italic_d )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nRecurrent\\nO\\u2062(n‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nO\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n )\\nO\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n )\\nConvolutional\\nO\\u2062(k‚ãÖn‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëòùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_k ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(l\\u2062o\\u2062gk\\u2062(n))ùëÇùëôùëúsubscriptùëîùëòùëõO(log_{k}(n))italic_O ( italic_l italic_o italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n ) )\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO\\u2062(r‚ãÖn‚ãÖd)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëüùëõùëëO(r\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d)italic_O ( italic_r ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d )\\nO\\u2062(1)ùëÇ1O(1)italic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\u2062(n/r)ùëÇùëõùëüO(n/r)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_r )\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O\\u2062(n)ùëÇùëõO(n)italic_O ( italic_n ) sequential operations.\\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length nùëõnitalic_n is smaller than the representation dimensionality dùëëditalic_d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations.\\nTo improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rùëüritalic_r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O\\u2062(n/r)ùëÇùëõùëüO(n/r)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_r ). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<nùëòùëõk<nitalic_k < italic_n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O\\u2062(n/k)ùëÇùëõùëòO(n/k)italic_O ( italic_n / italic_k ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O\\u2062(l\\u2062o\\u2062gk\\u2062(n))ùëÇùëôùëúsubscriptùëîùëòùëõO(log_{k}(n))italic_O ( italic_l italic_o italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n ) ) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.\\nConvolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of kùëòkitalic_k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O\\u2062(k‚ãÖn‚ãÖd+n‚ãÖd2)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëòùëõùëë‚ãÖùëõsuperscriptùëë2O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d+n\\\\cdot d^{2})italic_O ( italic_k ‚ãÖ italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d + italic_n ‚ãÖ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Even with k=nùëòùëõk=nitalic_k = italic_n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer\\xa0[20] with Œ≤1=0.9subscriptùõΩ10.9\\\\beta_{1}=0.9italic_Œ≤ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.9, Œ≤2=0.98subscriptùõΩ20.98\\\\beta_{2}=0.98italic_Œ≤ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.98 and œµ=10‚àí9italic-œµsuperscript109\\\\epsilon=10^{-9}italic_œµ = 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table\\xa03.\\nIn Table\\xa03 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table\\xa03 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dksubscriptùëëùëòd_{k}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input.\\nFurthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dm\\u2062o\\u2062d\\u2062e\\u2062l=1024subscriptùëëùëöùëúùëëùëíùëô1024d_{model}=1024italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_o italic_d italic_e italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section\\xa05.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we increased the maximum output length to input length + 300300300300. We used a beam size of 21212121 and Œ±=0.3ùõº0.3\\\\alpha=0.3italic_Œ± = 0.3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\\nOur results in Table\\xa04 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.\\nMaking generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for\\ntheir fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]\\nJimmy\\xa0Lei Ba, Jamie\\xa0Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey\\xa0E Hinton.\\nLayer normalization.\\narXiv preprint arXiv:1607.06450, 2016.\\n[2]\\nDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio.\\nNeural machine translation by jointly learning to align and\\ntranslate.\\nCoRR, abs/1409.0473, 2014.\\n[3]\\nDenny Britz, Anna Goldie, Minh-Thang Luong, and Quoc\\xa0V.

Today, we‚Äôre diving into one of the most influential papers in the field of deep learning, titled \"Attention Is All You Need.\" This groundbreaking work comes from a team at Google Brain, featuring notable researchers such as Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, and Niki Parmar, among others.\\n\\nI‚Äôm thrilled to have with me today Mike, an expert in machine learning and natural language processing, who will help unpack the intricate details of this paper. \\n\\nWhy is this paper so significant? Well, it introduces the Transformer model, which has fundamentally changed the way we approach sequence transduction tasks, particularly in machine translation. By eliminating the need for recurrence and convolutions, the Transformer architecture uses attention mechanisms to enable parallelization, making it not only faster but also more effective at capturing long-range dependencies in data. So, let\\'s get started on this fascinating journey through attention and its implications for the future of AI!',\n",
